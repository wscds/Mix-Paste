# Mix-Paste: A Data Augmentation Technique for X-Ray Prohibited Item Detection under Noisy Annotations

This repository contains the source code for the paper *"Augmentation Matters: A Mix-Paste Method for X-Ray Prohibited Item Detection under Noisy Annotations."* The Mix-Paste method enhances detection performance, particularly when dealing with noisy annotations in X-ray images.

## Environment Setup

This implementation is based on the MMDetection framework (version 2.28.2) and requires PyTorch (version 1.12.0). Before running the code, ensure that the appropriate versions of the dependencies are installed.

To install MMDetection and other necessary packages, follow the instructions provided in the [MMDetection repository](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).

### Key Dependencies:
- mmdetection 2.28.2
- PyTorch 1.12.0

## Training

To train the model using the Mix-Paste augmentation technique, run the following command:

```bash
python tools/train.py configs/mixpaste/mixpaste.py
```

This will use the configuration specified in `configs/mixpaste/mixpaste.py`.

## Tips

- **Mix-Paste Configuration:** The core configuration for the Mix-Paste augmentation method can be found in the file `configs/mixpaste/mixpaste.py`.
